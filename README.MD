## Facets Overview
Overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. It produces a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis, and can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets. 

## Facets Dive
Dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details.

## Features

- Automatic data model documentation with JSON Schema (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema).
- Designed around these standards, after a meticulous study. Instead of an afterthought layer on top.
- Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI, with interactive exploration, call and test your API directly from the browser.
